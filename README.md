This program allows the user to create HTML maps in folium that show the flights between all the airports within a given radius of two locations.

The program uses a data set of airports from 2017 and flight paths from 2014. The data is from https://openflights.org/data.html, is in the public domain, and is NOT suitable for planning travel.

The map is built using folium, ARCGIS, and geographiclib to draw the geodesic lines.

This program can be implemented in a website e.g.: https://simple-website112233.herokuapp.com/flightsearch/

The locations and the radius around them can be changed in the main.py file.
